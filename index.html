    <h2>The early days</h2>
    <p class="text__general">Ah, where to begin? Our master, Christophe Plantin, is a man of mystery.<br><br>
      I’ve worked in his shop for many years, and though I see him every day, there’s a part of him that feels like a
      closed
      book.</p>
    <!-- <div>

  </div>

  <div class="attack__box">
    <p class="text__general text__attack">An older worker told me he was a bookbinder at first. But one night, while
      Plantin was
      pondering the streets of Antwerp,
      he got attacked!</p>

    <div><img class="collage" src="./assets/attack-collage.png" alt="collage"></div>
  </div>

  <p class="text__general text__attack">The injury to his arm left him unable to work as a bookbinder. And so he had no
    choice but
    to go for a different
    careerpath, he became a bookbinder. I tend to believe this story, it’s just too crazy to make up!

    <h2>The art of book printing</h2>
    <p class="text__general">Well, before i can tell you the juicy stories, i’ll first give some information on what
      book printing actually
      is, don’t
      worry i’ll keep it short and easy to understand!</p>
    <div>
      <h3>Setting the type</h3>
      <p class="text__general">First things first, setting the type. It all begins with selecting tiny metal letters,
        each one carefully
        chosen and
        arranged in reverse order. Line by painstaking line, these letters are assembled into a block of text, ready to
        tell a
        story or share a piece of knowledge. The process demands incredible focus and patience, as a single mistake—a
        letter
        placed in the wrong spot or upside down—can ruin an entire page.</p>
      <div><img class="collage" src="./assets/type-collage.png" alt="collage"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The printing press</h3>
      <p class="text__general">Once the type is set, the next step is to bring it to life with ink. We begin by coating
        the surface of the type with
        ink, applied using soft leather pads called ink balls. These pads are expertly dabbed and rolled across the tiny
        metal
        letters. It’s a delicate process, too much ink, and the letters will smudge, too little, and the impression will
        be
        faint. The ink itself is thick and rich, with a distinct smell that fills the air.</p>

        Printing is about so much more than just technique. It’s not just setting type, inking plates, and pulling
        levers—it’s
        about bringing ideas to life. It’s about stories, knowledge, and the way words can connect us all.<br><br>

        In our shop, we print books in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and even more languages. It’s fascinating how words from so
        many
        places come together here, on our presses.

      <p class="text__general text__illustrations">We also use intricate woodblocks
        for illustrations. These are carved by
        master artisans, their designs mirroring
        the intricacy of the written word. <br><br>
        Sometimes, I watch them at work and marvel at their skill. A single woodblock can take days to carve, but the
        result?</p>

    <h2>Shady stories</h2>
    <p class="text__general">Now that you understand the basics of the job you deserve to know some secret
      stories!<br><br>Master Plantin has
      always been a man of ambition, but ambition has its risks. He printed books that others might call…
      controversial.<br><br>There even were times he printed Illegal books, after all, he was a business man doing
      business.</p>
    <div>
      <h3>Printing illegal books</h3>
      <p class="text__general">Man oh man, printing those illegal books isn’t all that easy, there was a lot of things
        to take into account while
        printing them. Who do you trust? Where and when do we print them? Of course everyone would do it in a different
        way,
        some probably won’t even take the risk. But my boss? he is just looking to do business, so you could say taking
        a
        calculated risk is his hobby.

      <h3>Friends at auction</h3>
      <p class="text__general">He always has some tricks to outsmart everyone, when the company went bankrupt because of creditors, his
        friends bought
        the company at the public auction. This way we could continue to work for Plantin, as sneaky as it is, i must
        admire him
        for these moves!</p>
