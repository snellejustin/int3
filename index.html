            in 1520, others say it was 1514... anyway, what
            I do know is that when he was just 14, his father left him behind in Paris so he could study. His father

        <h3>Setting the type</h3>
        <p class="text__general">First things first, setting the type. It all begins with selecting tiny metal letters,
          each one carefully
          chosen and
          arranged in reverse order. Line by painstaking line, these letters are assembled into a block of text, ready
          to
          tell a
          story or share a piece of knowledge. The process demands incredible focus and patience, as a single mistake—a
          letter
          placed in the wrong spot or upside down—can ruin an entire page.</p>

        <h3>The printing press</h3>
        <p class="text__general">Once the type is set, the next step is to bring it to life with ink. We begin by
          coating
          the surface of the type with
          ink, applied using soft leather pads called ink balls. These pads are expertly dabbed and rolled across the
          tiny
          metal
          letters. It’s a delicate process, too much ink, and the letters will smudge, too little, and the impression
          will
          be
          faint. The ink itself is thick and rich, with a distinct smell that fills the air.</p>

      Printing is about so much more than just technique. It’s not just setting type, inking plates, and pulling

      about bringing ideas to life. It’s about stories, knowledge, and the way words can connect us all.<br><br>

      In our shop, we print books in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and even more languages. It’s fascinating how words from so
      many
      places come together here, on our presses.

    <h2>Shady stories</h2>

      stories!<br><br>Master Plantin has
      always been a man of ambition, but ambition has its risks. He printed books that others might call…
      controversial.<br><br>There even were times he printed Illegal books, after all, he was a business man doing
      business.</p>

        printing them. Who do you trust? Where and when do we print them? Of course everyone would do it in a different
        way,
        some probably won’t even take the risk. But my boss? he is just looking to do business, so you could say taking
        a
        calculated risk is his hobby.</p>

            <p class="letter__title">Dear Jaques,</p>
            <div>
              <p class="letter__text">You were right to voice your concerns, and I must now share with you news that
                confirms the very fears you warned me
                about. Word has reached me that the Spanish authorities have seized a shipment of our books, a
                staggering 1000 copies.
                These were not printed here, as it happens, but by three of our French colleagues while I was away in
                Paris visiting an
                old friend.</p>
              <p class="letter__text">Their actions were bold, perhaps too bold, and now the consequences have come down
                like a hammer. The Spanish have
                uncovered their operation, and the punishment was swift: forced labor aboard the galleys. A grim fate
                for anyone, but as
                fortune would have it, they managed to escape and have now fled back to France.</p>
              <p class="letter__text">This news is both troubling and bewildering. Their escape may have spared them,
                but it leaves us in an uneasy position.</p>

      <p class="text__general">He always has some tricks to outsmart everyone, when the company went bankrupt because of
        creditors, his
        friends bought
        the company at the public auction. This way we could continue to work for Plantin, as sneaky as it is, i must
        admire him
        for these moves!</p>

          other rich guys,
          tried to
          buy freedom of religion for
          3 million gulden.
          <br><br>
          We printed the text of this petition at our printing shop. Spanish king Filip II denied, the inventors of
          the idea
          then
          used the money to buy troops against Filip, the inventors got caught and fled to Germany.
