    <h2>The early days</h2>
    <p class="text__general">Ah, where to begin? Our master, Christophe Plantin, is a man of mystery.<br><br>
      I’ve worked in his shop for many years, and though I see him every day, there’s a part of him that feels like a
      closed
      book.</p>

  <div class="attack__box">
    <p class="text__general text__attack">An older worker told me he was a bookbinder at first. But one night, while
      Plantin was
      pondering the streets of Antwerp,
      he got attacked!</p>

  </div>

  <p class="text__general text__attack">The injury to his arm left him unable to work as a bookbinder. And so he had no
    choice but
    to go for a different
    careerpath, he became a bookbinder. I tend to believe this story, it’s just too crazy to make up!

    <h2>The art of book printing</h2>
    <p class="text__general">Well, before i can tell you the juicy stories, i’ll first give some information on what
      book printing actually
      is, don’t
      worry i’ll keep it short and easy to understand!</p>

      <h3>Setting the type</h3>
      <p class="text__general">First things first, setting the type. It all begins with selecting tiny metal letters,
        each one carefully
        chosen and
        arranged in reverse order. Line by painstaking line, these letters are assembled into a block of text, ready to
        tell a
        story or share a piece of knowledge. The process demands incredible focus and patience, as a single mistake—a
        letter
        placed in the wrong spot or upside down—can ruin an entire page.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The printing press</h3>
      <p class="text__general">Once the type is set, the next step is to bring it to life with ink. We begin by coating
        the surface of the type with
        ink, applied using soft leather pads called ink balls. These pads are expertly dabbed and rolled across the tiny
        metal
        letters. It’s a delicate process, too much ink, and the letters will smudge, too little, and the impression will
        be
        faint. The ink itself is thick and rich, with a distinct smell that fills the air.</p>
